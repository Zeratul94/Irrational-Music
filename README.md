# Irrational-Music

This project will generate music forever, building chords and melody based on the digits of a number. It knows the irrationals pi, e, phi (golden ratio), and natural logs, and it can interpret regular decimal numbers, too!

Download my sketchy .exe file to try it out, or download the code! (You'll need a Python interpreter in that case.)

You'll need a MIDI environment set up to receive messages and play sound, since this program only handles the MIDI end.
